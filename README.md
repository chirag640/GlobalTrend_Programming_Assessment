## MaxHeap Class
The MaxHeap class implements a max-heap data structure where the maximum element is
always at the root.
- `insert(element)`: Inserts a new element into the heap and maintains the max-heap property.
- `delete()`: Removes and returns the maximum element from the heap.
- `get_max()`: Returns the maximum element without removing it.
- `_heapify_up(index)`: Ensures the heap property is maintained after insertion.
- `_heapify_down(index)`: Ensures the heap property is maintained after deletion.
Modules Required: None
## URL Downloader
This script defines a function `download_urls(urls)` that downloads content from a list of URLs
with up to three attempts in case of failure.
- Utilizes the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests.
- Handles exceptions and retries downloading if an error occurs.
Modules Required: requests (install using `pip install requests`)
## Linear Regression ModelProgramming Assessment Code Explanations by Chirag Chaudhary
This code demonstrates how to create a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn.
- Loads a sample dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trains the model and evaluates its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Modules Required: pandas, scikit-learn (install using `pip install pandas scikit-learn`)
## DataFrame Cleaning with Pandas
This script defines a function `clean_dataframe(df)` to clean a pandas DataFrame.
- Handles missing values by dropping rows with any NaN values.
- Normalizes numerical columns.
- Encodes categorical columns using one-hot encoding.
Modules Required: pandas (install using `pip install pandas`)
## Recursive Fibonacci
This function `fibonacci(n)` calculates the nth Fibonacci number using a recursive approach.
Modules Required: NoneProgramming Assessment Code Explanations by Chirag Chaudhary
Division with Error Handling
This script defines a function `divide_numbers(a, b)` that performs division and handles division
by zero errors.
- Returns a custom error message if division by zero is attempted.
Modules Required: None
## Execution Time Decorator
This script defines a decorator `execution_time_decorator` that logs the execution time of a
function.
- Utilizes the `time` and `logging` libraries to measure and log execution time.
Modules Required: time, logging (logging is included in the Python Standard Library)
## Arithmetic Operation
This script defines a function `arithmetic_operation(a, b, operator)` to perform basic arithmetic
operations.Programming Assessment Code Explanations by Chirag Chaudhary
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles division by zero errors.
Modules Required: None
## Random Password Generator
This script defines a function `generate_random_password(length=12)` to generate a random
password of a specified length.
- Ensures the password includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit,
and one special character.
- Utilizes the `random` and `string` libraries.
Modules Required: random, string (both are included in the Python Standard Library)
## Matrix Transpose
This script defines a function `transpose_matrix(matrix)` that returns the transpose of a given
matrix.
- Uses list comprehension and the `zip` function to transpose the matrix.
Modules Required: None
